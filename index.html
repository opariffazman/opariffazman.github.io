		<h1>This is my website.</h1>
		<aside>A very simple website.</aside>
	</header>
	<h2>Because it serves a specific purpose.</h2>
	<p>Answering the famous question "tell me about yourself":
	<ul>
		<li>My name's Ariff, born in 1995.
		<li>From Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia.
		<li>Passed out from Royal Military College.
		<li>Graduated with honours as a Software Engineer.
		<li>And accumulated lots of experiences doing scripting, programming, devops, sre or basically an all around
			engineering.
	</ul>
	<p>I do it everyday, well most 'em, other days I plays video games and enjoys doing some reverse engineering by
		modding them. Feel free to check my <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/users/16167329?tab=user+files"
			target="_blank">mods</a> on nexus.
	<h3 id="time">No amount of money ever bought a second of time.</h3>
	<p>Why waste so much time and effort doing such repetitive task over and over again when you can fully teach machines
		to do the same thing but way better, and faster.
	<p>I'd spent 6 hours to automate a repetitive task that can be
		completed in minutes so that it can be done with zero human intervention and more efficient.
	<h3 id="tech">Not wasting anymore of your time.</h3>
	<p>Here's my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UB8o9rldY0E6W-EBWi4poSvdeZzsg6gY/view?usp=sharing"
			target="_blank">resume</a> and <a
			href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11G0NIAPkZMD8O4xWH9UyUiNanpKy2vxn/view?usp=sharing"
			target="_blank">curriculum vitae</a>. With a brief list of my tech stacks:
	<ul>
		<li>CI/CD, GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps.
		<li>Scripting, PowerShell, JavaScript, Bash, Python.
		<li>Programming, C++, C#, C, PHP, Java, (SQL, HTML & CSS too).
		<li>Virtualization & Computing, VMWare, Azure, AWS.
		<li>Containerization, Docker, OpenShift.
	</ul>
	<h2>It's not about the steel, but the one who wields it.</h2>
	<h3 id="tool">All those powerful tools not completely utilized.</h3>
	<p>Tons of various tools on our disposal but unless one be a master of its craft, none of it matters. Such are
		meticulously crafted swords for ones' who shot arrows for all their lifetimes.
	<p>Forget about the tools. The ones' using it that matters. Don't learn programming languages, learn how to solve
		problems with them instead.
	<h2>This is the end of my website. Look at it.</h2>
	<p>If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Keep it simple stupid (KISS).

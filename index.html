	<h2>That serves a certain purpose.</h2>
	<p>About me, myself & I:
	<ul>
		<li>My name is Ariff, a 90's kid from Malaysia also known as opsedar.
		<li>Marched out from the Royal Military College with Basic Military Training.
		<li>Graduated with Bcs. of Software Engineering from Universiti Tenaga Nasional.
		<li>Accumulated experiences doing automation, scripting, programming, devops with an all around engineering throughout my journey.
		<li>In case of a fire, I make it a habit to always <a href="https://github.com/opariffazman" target="_blank">commit</a> the good stuffs.
	</ul>
	<p>I do it everyday, other days I'm on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/opsedar/" target="_blank">steam</a> playing video games and enjoys doing some reverse engineering by
		making mods. Maybe you've played with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/users/16167329?tab=user+files" target="_blank">them</a> before?
	<h3 id="tech">Not wasting any more of your time.</h3>
	<p>Here's my <a href="pdf/ariff-resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> and <a href="pdf/ariff-cv.pdf" target="_blank">curriculum vitae</a>. Also an overview of my tech stacks:
	<ul>
		<li>Scripting, PowerShell, Bash, Python.
		<li>Programming, JavaScript, C++, C, Lua.
		<li>CI/CD, TeamCity, Jenkins, GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps.
		<li>Infrastructure Services, Windows & Linux Dedicated Server OSes.
		<li>Virtualization & Containerization, HyperV, VMWare, OVF & Docker.
		<li>Cloud Services, Azure Functions & PlayFab, AWS Lambdas & GameLift.
		<li>Game Engines, Unreal Engine, Godot, Defold, Phaser3 & RPGMaker.
	</ul>
	<h3 id="time">No amount of money ever bought a second of time.</h3>
	<p>I'd spent 6 hours to automate a repetitive task that can be
		completed in minutes so that machine can do it without errors and faster.
	<h3 id="tool">It's not about the steel, but the one who wields it.</h2>
		<p>Forget about the tools. The ones' using it that matters. Don't just learn programming languages, learn how to
			solve problems instead.
		<h2>This is the end of my website.</h2>
		<p>Keep on Keeping on!

		<h1>This is my website.</h1>
		<aside>A very simple website.</aside>

	<h2>Because it serves a certain purpose.</h2>
	<p>Answering the famous question <i>"tell me about yourself"</i>:
	<ul>
		<li>Given the name Ariff.
		<li>Born on the '95, from Malaysia.
		<li>Passed out from the Royal Military College.
		<li>Graduated with honours as a Software Engineer on 2017.
		<li>Accumulated experiences doing scripting, programming, devops, sre or basically an all around
			engineering throughout my career. My <a href="https://github.com/opariffazman" target="_blank">GitHub</a> profile.
	</ul>
	<p>I do it everyday, other days I'm on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/opsedar/" target="_blank">steam</a> playing video games and enjoys doing some reverse engineering by
		modding them. Feel free to check them on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/users/16167329?tab=user+files"
			target="_blank">nexus mods</a>
	<h3 id="tech">Not wasting anymore of your time.</h3>
	<p>Here's my <a href="pdf/ariff-resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> and <a
			href="pdf/ariff-cv.pdf" target="_blank">curriculum vitae</a>. And a list of my tech stacks:
	<ul>
		<li>CI/CD, TeamCity, Jenkins, GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps.
		<li>Scripting, PowerShell, JavaScript <i>(NodeJS/server-side)</i>, Bash, Python.
		<li>Programming, C++, C, Lua, <i>(SQL, HTML5 & CSS3)</i>.
		<li>PaaS, Azure Functions, Azure PlayFab & Aws GameLift
		<li>Infrastructure Services, Windows OS & Linux.
		<li>Virtualization & Computing, VMWare, Azure VM & Aws EC2.
		<li>Containerization, Docker & OpenShift.
		<li>Game Development, Unreal Engine, Godot & RPGMaker.
	</ul>
	<h3 id="time">No amount of money ever bought a second of time.</h3>
	<p>Why waste so much time and effort doing such repetitive task over and over again when you can fully teach machines
		to do the same thing but way better, and faster.
	<p>I'd spent 6 hours to automate a repetitive task that can be
		completed in minutes so that it can be done with zero human intervention and more efficient.
	<h3 id="tool">It's not about the steel, but the one who wields it.</h2>
		<p>With an arsenal of resources unless one be a master of its craft, none of it matters. Such are meticulously
			crafted
			swords for ones' who shot arrows for all their lifetimes (except if you're HawkEye).
		<p>Forget about the tools. The ones' using it that matters. Don't just learn programming languages, learn how to
			solve
			problems with them instead. End of the day, it's only about the endgame. Agree?
		<h2>This is the end of my website. Look at it.</h2>
		<p>If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Keep it simple stupid.

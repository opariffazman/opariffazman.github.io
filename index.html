		<h1>This is my website.</h1>
	</header>
	<p>About me:
	<ul>
		<li>My name is Ariff Bin Azman and the <a href="https://github.com/opariffazman" target="_blank">GitHub</a> handler is "opariffazman" because the "OP" stands for "overpowered"
		<li>Jokes aside it is actually an alumni form of my college that means "Old Putera" or "Old Prince"
		<li>I have worked with GLCs & MNCs throughout my career as well as indie & small studios
		<li>During my time, I've spearheaded organizations cultural shift to adopt DevOps emphasizing in continuous improvement & continuous deployment
		<li>Mainly through fostering tight collaboration between development & operation processes through automation, lots & lots of automation
	</ul>
	<h3 id="tech">Not wasting any more of your time.</h3>
	<p>Here's my updated <a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/RRSJRZ30Y0#Llet0vfgOacD" target="_blank">resume</a> and my tech stacks:
	<ul>
		<li>TeamCity, Jenkins, GitHub, Perforce, SVN
		<li>PowerShell, JavaScript (NodeJS/server-side), Bash, Python
		<li>HashiCorp [Terraform, Packer, Vault], Ansible
		<li>Azure Functions & Aws Lambdas, Azure PlayFab & Aws GameLift
		<li>InfluxDB, Grafana, Prometheus
		<li>Proxmox, VMWare, Azure VM & Aws EC2
		<li>LXCs, Docker & Kubernetes
		<li>Unreal Engine, Godot & RPGMaker
	</ul>
	<h3 id="time">No amount of money ever bought a second of time.</h3>
	<p>I'd spent 6 hours to automate a repetitive task that can be
		completed in minutes so that machine can do it without errors and faster.
	<h3 id="tool">It's not about the steel, but the one who wields it.</h2>
		<p>Forget about the tools. The ones' using it that matters. Don't just learn programming languages, learn how to
			solve problems instead.
		<h2>This is the end of my website.</h2>
		<p>Keep on Keeping on!
	<h3 id="bonus">If you stick around till now, let me show you something.</h3>
		<p>Recently I've dived into some fun & cool projects:
		<ul>
			<li>An overview of my <a href="images/homelab.png" target="_blank">home-lab</a> setup</li>
			<li>Setup local generative AI Stable Diffusion <a href="videos/SDXLTurbo.mp4" target="_blank">SDXL Turbo</a> model</li>
		</ul>
